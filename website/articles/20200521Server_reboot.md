# The great server reset

After 7 years of using a small, 1 core, .5GB of RAM, and 10GB of Disk. The
hosting platform decided to refresh the server, and I had to migrate 7 years of
scritps and random files.

Instead of this, I decided to back-up what I had, and start fresh with good
resolutions, and hope to keep this place clean. This usually lasts until I try
to install something that is more complex than nginx. So this time, I've created
a [script](https://github.com/bliiben/ub2004_install) that can simply re-install
the server if needs be.
