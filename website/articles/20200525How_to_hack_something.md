# Why I like hacking

## My hacking life

My hacking life started many years ago, for me it means _understanding systems_,
with that knowledge comes the knowledge of how can they then be exploited.

I'm more interested with how the exploit works, than using the exploit itself.
I would not be a good penetration tester, there is just too many repetitions
part of the daily job.

I remember being a teenager, and hacking my friend's websites, and being hacked
in return. You learn a lot when you're hacked about the tools that exist, XSS is
a common trap, as there is nothing better than to see a big alert popping up,
telling you 'Sucka !'.

Finding an exploit, this is fun. This is a challenge, side channels attack are
my favorite type of attacks. Because they are weird. I like weird, I'm weird.
gets function with buffer overflow, is so an easy introduction to assembly, and
how processes work.

I also love the speed run community for this, not the repetition and the grind,
but the analysis required to understand how to exploit a system. Trying to break
the system enough to abuse it, but not too much that it breaks the game.

## How to get in the field

I recommend to try understanding how something works in details. Like how WiFi
works. How WEP, WPA works. How the network works, ARP, Mac addresses. How
bitcoins works, I've re-implemented sha256 square for that pupose. Then there
are CTF (capture the flag), these are challenges that gives you something to
hack. LiveOverflow over on youtube has great and accessible content on that.

You don't have to hack computers, hacking is just repurposing things that were
not supposed to be repurposed. I would adventure to say, that hacking also is
prototyping.
